            Along with her responsibilities as CHO (Chief Happiness Officer), Jenn Lim travels around the world to deliver a message of passion, purpose, culture, and happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jenn has been a consultant with Zappos from its start-up days in 2003 to the $2B business it is today. She created the Zappos Culture Book, an embodiment of how companies can use happiness as a business model to increase productivity and profitability. Jenn’s experience with Zappos, combined with her development of scientific frameworks for workplace happiness, created the evidence that happier employees = happier customers = successful companies (and meaningful lives). What’s more, she discovered that every organization can have similar results. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Jenn is dedicated to growing DH to inspire happiness in people, companies and communities so that together, we can create a happier world.
